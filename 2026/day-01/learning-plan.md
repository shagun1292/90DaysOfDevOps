	•	What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?  
I have been working as a software developer from past 5 years. In my day to day development operations, I am following the CI/CD approach to fast track the delivery of the projects and I have to use the devops tools to push the code/deploy code/monitor if deployment failed but that too on a very basic level. More of a application related montioring.   

All of our application have been hosted on the GCP cloud server.  I have an idea about the  cloud infrasturcture but a very basic level of understanding I have not in depth. 


	•	Why you are starting learning DevOps & Cloud?

First reason: I want to upskill myself in this AI era and would like to learn something new and interested.  
Second reason: Job Switch - I would like to change my current profile or boost my profile for career growth/good hike. 
Third reason:  Being a Java Developer, I would like to know the background task as well.  How we are able to deploy our code so easily, want to know what is happening behind the scene. 


	•	Where do you want to reach?


Honestly, at this point of time. I would like to learn as much as I can and proof myself that I can do what I really wanted to do.  its not a dream that keeps you motivated its a hardwork you put behind to make you feel motivated. 

During the entire 90 days of time, I want to put hardwork, dedication to reach at a point where in my resume, I can confidently write down the things by myself and can easily present them in front of the interviewers without any fear. 

	•	How you will stay consistent every single day?
I believe in learning and that makes me happy and if that is consistent, I believe no one can stop me from what I want to achieve. 

In weekdays- I will take out an hour daily to go through the materials/videos that have been provided and will do a lot of hands on pratice to keep my self up to the speed. 

Weekends: 2-3 hours
